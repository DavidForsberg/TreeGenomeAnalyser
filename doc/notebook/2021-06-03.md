First version done. Remove the other storing methods, now using only adjacency list as graph representation.

Using: 

 - DFS traversion
 - Adjacency list as hashmap with key: integer, and value: arraylist (integers) as neighbors. 

Things to fix:

 - Integer to custom vertex class
 - Still having problems on the big file (.m4)
    - stackoverflowerror on dfs search, implement a iterative version of the DFS/connected components method.
 - Is it computing correctly?
 - Overlap calculations
    -	"if the whole contig is involved in the overlap, then this line can be ignored: it should not define and edge"
    -	"the overlap is actually containment if contig A is a subsequence of contig B - then A should be discarded because its redundant"
    -	contig A: 0 - n with length n, or contig B: 0 - n with length n.
