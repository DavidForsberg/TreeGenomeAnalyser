Wrote the code (in python) to compute the visualizations of the test results. To be able to create these diagrams of the test results I implemented a new function saveOutput(). This function is ran when the user specifies -save_output argument when running the compiled jar file. It creates two new CSV files, or overwrites the existing files.

Both of the csv files are formatted equally, the difference is the node *degree* and component *size*. The Python script creates histograms using matplotlib for plotting and Pandas for reading the created csv files.
