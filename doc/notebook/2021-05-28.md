**Learning the structures**

During the week I didn't do anything on the project itself, but chose to study some of the important data structures to feel more confident about how I should approach the project itself.

I reviewed both the ones on Athena's Kurskanal, some online resources and the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book. 

Later during the day I also chose to create a .gitignore file to stop commiting the IDE setting folder, aswell as the output folder.
