**This is folder contains Python scripts or visualizing the collected data from running the main program.**

Running the scripts are *not needed*, but just an additional way to explore the computed data. In the report.md file there are some simple images of the distributions.



**Running the scripts**

Required Python packages are Matplotlib.

To be able to run the visualization scripts, the user has to run the compiled JAR file of the main program with the argument *-save_output*

Ex.

â€‹	cat spruce_fingerprint.m4 | Java -jar program.jar -save_output
